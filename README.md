### Case Study
The significance of food in our lives is self-evident and unquestionable. Over the past years, the food industry has witnessed exponential growth in online food ordering, driven by digital convenience. The food ordering platform has tremendously transformed the restaurant industry since the implementation of Movement Control Orders (MCOs), emphasizing the importance of adaptable solutions for restaurants. 

Introducing the Restaurant Food Ordering System, a centralized platform specifically developed for a variety of restaurants, ranging from Malay, Chinese to Western and Japanese cuisines. The growing popularity of the food ordering system has created more business opportunities for aspiring new restaurants. The food ordering system has altered business owners’ and customers’ routines. 

The ordering process via the system is done at the premises. On this digital platform, customers and staff can access the four subsystems by logging in and inputting the user ID and password before proceeding to the system's mainframe. On the main page, customers need to choose a particular restaurant to order food either from Malay, Western, Chinese, or Japanese restaurant. Customers can view and browse the menu list based on their chosen restaurant category. In addition, it displays detailed information such as food names and prices. After that, customers can check out and place their orders. The payment selections include paying at the counter or through the system using debit card, credit card, or QR payment such as Touch ’n Go eWallet. Meanwhile, the staff who handle this system act as administrators to manage the restaurant and its operation efficiently. 

By seamlessly integrating all four subsystems into a unified platform, the Restaurant Food Ordering System not only simplifies the ordering process but also eliminates the hassle of ordering face-to-face and enhances convenience for all parties involved. It caters to the diverse needs of customers but also empowers restaurant owners to thrive in the continuously changing food industry.


### Problem Statement
The increasing number of digital food ordering platforms has brought a significant change in the food sector of Malaysia. But even amid this digital revolution, there is still a significant weakness in the market: there is no centralized system for ordering foods suited to Malaysia's varied culinary scene. Although useful, current platforms do not sufficiently address the distinct tastes and needs of Malaysian customers, especially when it comes to Malay, Chinese, Western, and Japanese cuisines. In addition to making ordering more difficult for customers, such a division presents staff and restaurant owners with operational difficulties that limit productivity and growth prospects for the sector.

Separate subsystem management adds another level of complexity to an already difficult operating environment for restaurant owners and employees. Managing several platforms raises the possibility of variations and operational bottlenecks in addition to consuming important time and resources. Thus, a complete Restaurant Food Ordering System that smoothly combines the subsystems of Malay, Chinese, Western, and Japanese restaurants into a single platform is desperately needed. Customers' ordering processes would be made simpler by such a system, which would also improve operational effectiveness and create a solid foundation for future development and innovation in the Malaysian food sector.

In conclusion, developing a comprehensive Restaurant Food Ordering System designed for the Malaysian food industry is important for resolving the issues caused by inconsistent ordering experiences and ineffective operational procedures. The suggested system has the potential to revolutionize the food business in Malaysia by utilizing technology to bridge the gap between customers and restaurants. This could lead to increased convenience, efficiency, and growth opportunities for everyone involved.


### Objectives
The project's objective is to create a centralized platform that caters to Malay, Chinese, Western, and Japanese cuisines. Its main aim is to improve customer satisfaction and make the ordering process more efficient by offering a contactless ordering system. Combining all these different food choices into one place will make it easier and more accessible for customers to order.

Secondly, the next objective is to accommodate a huge amount of orders at a time with innovative solutions that will be created to ensure that ordering processes run smoothly. These solutions will efficiently manage restaurant operations because the automated ordering system allows the staff to serve the customer simultaneously and will reduce waiting times, ensuring a smooth ordering process for customers by addressing resource usage concerns.

Thirdly, to guarantee customer contentment. Writing down customer orders by hand can lead to delays in serving customers. Therefore, with the implementation of the Food Ordering System in the restaurant, customers can easily and quickly manipulate their orders by simply tapping on the screen and selecting the menu they want.


### Scope
The proposed Centralized Digital Food Ordering System will comprise four distinct subsystems tailored to different culinary styles: Malay, Western, Chinese, and Japanese. Each subsystem will offer users the ability to explore menus, place orders, and execute payments seamlessly within their chosen cuisine category. The system will ensure versatility by accommodating various payment methods, including credit/debit cards, thereby catering to diverse user preferences. 

The system will cater to a diverse range of target users seeking convenient and efficient food ordering experiences. Primarily, the system will target busy professionals, students, and families who prefer the convenience of ordering food from various cuisines without the hassle of visiting multiple restaurants. Additionally, tourists and travelers looking to explore local culinary offerings will find the system invaluable for discovering and ordering authentic Malay, Western, Chinese, and Japanese dishes in one centralized platform. By accommodating the needs and preferences of these target users, the system aims to enhance accessibility and satisfaction while revolutionizing the way individuals interact with restaurants and explore diverse cuisines. Prioritizing user experience, the system will emphasize intuitive navigation, responsive design, and efficient order processing to facilitate a seamless and enjoyable dining experience.
